Based on the Koala Satellite from FormatBCE. It's a mix between the Koala and the ReSpeaker Lite ESPHome.
More or less the Basic ReSpeaker Lite, with an added 20pcs WS2812 LED-strip.
Designed a new casing for it to match the exteriour of our place.

Removed the USR button since v1 doesn't have it. Added the extra LED-strip to D2 (GPIO3).

I kept it really simple, only an USB-C port on the back and go!

A big shoutout to FormatBCE for developing the code for the ReSpeaker Lite! https://github.com/formatBCE/Koala-Satellite
