# Koala-Satellite

This is the new device, based on software and (partially) hardware from [Respeaker Lite](https://github.com/formatBCE/Respeaker-Lite-ESPHome-integration) repository.
As the software evolved and hardware needs grew, i decided to branch out this ready-to-use device from main repo.
I will be adding parts and assembly instructions in the following weeks.

Meanwhile take a look at [images folder](/casing/images) to check how it looks in detail.
