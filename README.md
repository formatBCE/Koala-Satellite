This is the new device, based on software and (partially) hardware from [Respeaker Lite](https://github.com/formatBCE/Respeaker-Lite-ESPHome-integration) repository.
As the software evolved and hardware needs grew, i decided to branch out this ready-to-use device from main repo.

_**In short, you might think of it as NabuCasa Voice PE with very similar software and possibilities, but with better internal speaker (capable even for music playback to some extent) and better LED setup.**_

I will be adding detailed assembly instructions in the following weeks.
Meanwhile take a look at [images folder](/casing/images) to check how it looks in detail. Also you may find [STEP files](/casing/step) for 3D-printing.

Parts used:
- microphones and DAC/AMP: Respeaker Lite board (bare board, without XIAO-S3 soldered on;
- main board: ESP32-S3 DevkitC N16R8;
- rotary encoder: KY-040;
- LED: 144 diodes/meter addressable WS2812B, 43 diodes long;
- speaker: 2" 4Ohm 5W;
- M3 screws;
- threaded inserts;
- cords of various length.

Tools:
- 3D printer for enclosure printing (better is better, i use Bambulab A1);
- prints cleanup tool;
- soldering iron and accessories;
- threaded inserts installation tool;
- screwdriver or allen wrench for screws.
